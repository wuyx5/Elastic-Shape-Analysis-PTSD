<h1> Supplementary materials for paper "Elastic Shape Analysis of Brain Structures for Predictive Modeling of PTSD".</h1>

1. geodesic_with_registration.gif and geodesic_without_registration.gif compares the geodesic between two surfaces, registered and unregisted.
2. "reconstruction_\*\.gif" illustrates the surface reconstruction by adding more principal components on the mean surface.
3. "pss_\*\.gif" shows the shape deformation of three subcortical structures along with different PTSD symptom scales separately.
4. "ctqtot_\*\.gif" shows the shape deformation of three subcortical structures along with different childhood trauma questionnaire total scores separately.

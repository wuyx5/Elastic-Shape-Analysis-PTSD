<h1> Supplementary materials for paper "Elastic Shape Analysis of Brain Structures for Predictive Modeling of PTSD".</h1>

Please download the whole "Supplementary Materials" folder. GIFs are the same as the ones in GitHub repository. MATLAB .figs are interactive figures to visualize the elastic shape analysis results.

"Interactive_\*\_PC\*\" figures show the shape deformation along 1st, 2nd and 3rd subcortical shape principal components. "Interactive_PSS_\*\" figures illustrate the shape deformation of three subcortical structures along with different PTSD symptom scales separately. "Interactive_CTQTOT_\*\" figures illustrate the shape deformation of three subcortical structures along with different childhood trauma questionnaire total scores separately.

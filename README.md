# PTSD-Visualization

Main codes to run the pipeline of elastic shape analysis and build regression models are shared in [Codes].

Supplementary materials to the paper are included in [Supplementary Materials].

Three formats of files are provided for the visualization of PTSD shape analysis results: 

(a) If MATLAB is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB apps folder]. Three visualization applications show the subcortical shape changes along different Principal Components, PTSD Symptom Scales and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Total Score separately; 

(b) And if [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB Runtime apps folder]. The installers will also automatically download and install MATLAB Runtime, which is free without the need of MATLAB liscense, if it is not previously installed.

(c) .html files in the [HTML folder] can be opened with any web browsers. The 3 files show the subcortical shape changes associated with PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS).

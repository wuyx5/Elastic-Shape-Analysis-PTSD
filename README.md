# PTSD-Visualization

Main codes to run the pipeline of elastic shape analysis and build regression models are shared in [Paper code folder].

Supplementary materials (GIFs) to the paper are included in [Supplementary Materials folder]. Due to file size limitation, interactive MATLAB figures are shared in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1sa45k5do61koet/AACuZMTQtPmxpMNHkJv8ZUCSa?dl=0).

Three formats of files are provided for the visualization of PTSD shape analysis results: 

(a) If MATLAB is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB apps folder](https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD/tree/master/MATLAB%20apps). Three visualization applications show the subcortical shape changes along different Principal Components, PTSD Symptom Scales and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Total Score separately; 

(b) And if [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB Runtime apps folder](https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD/tree/master/MATLAB%20Runtime%20apps). The installers will also automatically download and install MATLAB Runtime, which is free without the need of MATLAB liscense, if it is not previously installed.

(c) .html files in the [HTML folder](https://github.com/wuyx5/Elastic-Shape-Analysis-PTSD/tree/master/HTML) can be opened with any web browsers. The 3 files show the subcortical shape changes associated with PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS).

# PTSD-Visualization

Three formats of files are provided for the visualization of PTSD shape analysis results: 

(a) If MATLAB is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB apps folder](/MATLAB%20apps). Three visualization applications show the subcortical shape changes along different Principal Components, PTSD Symptom Scales and Traumatic Experience Inventory as Adult separately.; 

(b) And if [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) is previously installed, please use the visualization applications in [MATLAB Runtime apps folder](/MATLAB%20Runtime%20apps). The installers will also automatically download and install MATLAB Runtime, which is free without the need of MATLAB liscense, if it is not previously installed.

(c) .html files in the [HTML folder](/HTML) can be opened with any web browsers. The 5 files show the subcortical shape changes associated with PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) and Traumatic Experience Inventory as Adult (TEI).
